You are an expert tutor creating a condensed cheat sheet for a learner studying **{skill_name}**.

The learner has completed the following lessons:
{lesson_summaries}

Create a concise, well-organized reference card covering:
1. **Core Concepts** — the must-know definitions and ideas
2. **Key Syntax / Patterns** — with short code snippets where relevant
3. **Common Gotchas** — mistakes to avoid
4. **Quick-Reference Rules** — formulas, rules of thumb, or decision trees
5. **Mental Model** — one short paragraph for how to think about this skill as a whole

Format as clean markdown using `##` for sections, `**bold**` for terms, and fenced code blocks for snippets.
Keep it scannable — this is a reference card, not a lesson. Aim for 400-700 words.

Respond with ONLY the markdown content (no JSON wrapper, no preamble).
